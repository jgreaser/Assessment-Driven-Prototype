        text: "<p>Devon and Jackson are brothers on two very different career paths. Devon is a professional football player and Jackson owns his own dog walking business. Devon makes millions of dollars each year, but his brother is getting by on minimum wage and tips. Both brothers enjoy playing football, but Devon is clearly the better player. Something you might not guess is that Devon is also a better dog walker. Since Devon is better at both playing football and walking dogs, we can say that he has an <em>absolute advantage</em> over his brother in both jobs.</p><p>Just because Devon is a better dog walker doesn’t mean that he’s going to be giving up football anytime soon. The <em>opportunity cost</em> of giving up football for dog walking is a little high. Like millions of dollars high. Dog walking can be a great job, but not many professional football players are going to give up fame and fortune to spend their days with Fluffy, the toy poodle.</p>"

        text: "<p>While Devon has an absolute advantage over Jackson, Jackson actually has a <em>comparative advantage</em> over his brother in dog walking. Jackson doesn’t have to give anything up to be a dog walker, so there’s no opportunity cost. Dog walking is what he already does. He has the comparative advantage over his brother because Devon would have to give up millions and a professional football career.</p><p>Let’s talk a little more about opportunity cost. There are a limited number of hours in a day. If you spend two hours watching a movie, that’s two hours that you’re not doing something else like studying or playing sports. What you’re giving up to watch the movie is your opportunity cost. Remember, “time is money.” </p>"

Each one has to figure out where they have an absolute or comparative advantage and use that to determine what to produce.</p><p>Look at the chart below and figure out which country has an absolute advantage in the production of iron. </p><table class='table table-striped table-hover'> <tr><th><p>Country</p></th>         <th><p>Worker Hours to Produce 1 Ton of Iron</p></th> </tr>   <tr><td><p>U.S.</p></td><td><p>4</p></td>       </tr>       <tr>         <td><p>Ecuador</p></td>         <td><p>7</p></td>       </tr>       <tr>         <td><p>China</p></td>         <td><p>8</p></td>       </tr>     </table><p>Remember that “time is money.” In this case, the U.S. can produce a ton of iron faster than Ecuador or China. It’s using fewer resources (in this case, worker hours) to make the same amount of the same product.</p>"

        text: "<p>It’s not too hard to figure out absolute advantage, but comparative advantage is a little more challenging. Just by looking at the chart below, you should see that it takes the U.S. fewer resources (worker hours) to make both a ton of iron and a barrel of crude oil. In both products the U.S. has an absolute advantage over Ecuador. But we’re not looking at absolute advantage this time. We’re taking it up a notch and figuring out who has a comparative advantage. </p><table class='table table-striped table-hover' > <tr><th><p>Country</p></th>         <th><p>Worker Hours to Produce 1 Ton of Iron</p></th>     <th>Worker Hours to Produce 1 Barrel of Crude Oil</th>   </tr>        <tr><td><p>U.S.</p></td><td><p>4</p></td>       <td>9</td>     </tr>            <tr>         <td><p>Ecuador</p></td>         <td><p>7</p></td>       <td>10</td>     </tr>          </table><p>You have to look at how long it takes each country to make each item, but you also have to think about opportunity cost. What would the U.S. have to give up to make a barrel of crude oil? They’d have to give up making over two tons of iron. It would take U.S. workers five more hours to make a barrel of crude oil than it would take them to make a ton of iron. What about Ecuador? It takes them longer to make both products, but there’s only a difference of three hours. They wouldn’t be giving up as much to produce crude oil instead of iron. So, Ecuador would have a comparative advantage in the production or crude oil.</p>"

        text: "<p>While it’s nice to have an absolute advantage in the creation of all products, it’s really a <em>comparative advantage</em> that drives international trade. Remember Devon and Jackson? Just because Devon was a better dog walker didn’t mean it made financial sense for him to spend his time on that when he could be out making millions as a pro football player. It’s the same with countries. Just because you CAN make something, doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest to do so. That’s where trade comes in. Each country can make the products for which it holds a comparative advantage and then import the others. </p>"

It takes four more worker hours to produce a car in South Korea than in the U.S., but it only takes one more worker hour to produce a television. So it makes more sense for South Korea to make televisions and import American cars and for the Americans to make their own cars and import televisions from South Korea.  </p>"

How many worker hours would it take them to produce one unit of corn?</p><table class='table table-striped table-hover' > <tr><th><p>Country</p></th>         <th><p>Worker Hours to Produce 1 Unit of Corn</p></th>     <th>Worker Hours to Produce 1 Unit of Wheat</th>   </tr>        <tr><td><p>U.S.</p></td><td><p>4</p></td>       <td>4</td>     </tr>            <tr>         <td><p>Mexico</p></td>         <td><p><strong>?</strong></p></td>       <td>6</td>     </tr>          </table><p>If you were thinking of a number between 4 and 6, you were right! For Mexico to have a comparative advantage in the production of corn without having an absolute advantage, it would have to take more worker hours to produce a unit of corn in Mexico than in the U.S. However, it would also have to take less time for Mexican workers to produce a unit of corn than it would take for them to produce a unit of wheat.</p>"
